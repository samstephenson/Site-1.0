                    <p>The boys were overwhelmed with delight at sight of the tears of senile  disappointment that dribbled down the old man's cheeks. Then, unnoticed,  Hoo-Hoo replaced the empty shell with a fresh-cooked crab. Already  dismembered, from the cracked legs the white meat sent forth a small  cloud of savory steam. This attracted the old man's nostrils, and he  looked down in amazement.</p>

                    <p>The change of his mood to one of joy was immediate. He snuffled and  muttered and mumbled, making almost a croon of delight, as he began  to eat. Of this the boys took little notice, for it was an accustomed  spectacle. Nor did they notice his occasional exclamations and  utterances of phrases which meant nothing to them, as, for instance,  when he smacked his lips and champed his gums while muttering:  "Mayonnaise! Just think&mdash;mayonnaise! And it's sixty years since the last  was ever made! Two generations and never a smell of it! Why, in those  days it was served in every restaurant with crab."</p>

                    <p>When he could eat no more, the old man sighed, wiped his hands on his  naked legs, and gazed out over the sea. With the content of a full  stomach, he waxed reminiscent.</p>

                    <p>"To think of it! I've seen this beach alive with men, women, and  children on a pleasant Sunday. And there weren't any bears to eat them  up, either. And right up there on the cliff was a big restaurant where  you could get anything you wanted to eat. Four million people lived in  San Francisco then. And now, in the whole city and county there aren't  forty all told. And out there on the sea were ships and ships always to  be seen, going in for the Golden Gate or coming out. And airships in the  air&mdash;dirigibles and flying machines. They could travel two hundred miles  an hour. The mail contracts with the New York and San Francisco Limited  demanded that for the minimum. There was a chap, a Frenchman, I forget  his name, who succeeded in making three hundred; but the thing was  risky, too risky for conservative persons. But he was on the right clew,  and he would have managed it if it hadn't been for the Great Plague.  When I was a boy, there were men alive who remembered the coming of the  first aeroplanes, and now I have lived to see the last of them, and that  sixty years ago."</p>

                    <p>The old man babbled on, unheeded by the boys, who were long accustomed  to his garrulousness, and whose vocabularies, besides, lacked the  greater portion of the words he used. It was noticeable that in these  rambling soliloquies his English seemed to recrudesce into better  construction and phraseology. But when he talked directly with the boys  it lapsed, largely, into their own uncouth and simpler forms.</p>

                    <p>"But there weren't many crabs in those days," the old man wandered on.  "They were fished out, and they were great delicacies. The open season  was only a month long, too. And now crabs are accessible the whole year  around. Think of it&mdash;catching all the crabs you want, any time you want,  in the surf of the Cliff House beach!"</p>

                    <p>A sudden commotion among the goats brought the boys to their feet. The  dogs about the fire rushed to join their snarling fellow who guarded the  goats, while the goats themselves stampeded in the direction of their  human protectors. A half dozen forms, lean and gray, glided about on the  sand hillocks and faced the bristling dogs. Edwin arched an arrow that  fell short. But Hare-Lip, with a sling such as David carried into battle  against Goliath, hurled a stone through the air that whistled from the  speed of its flight. It fell squarely among the wolves and caused them  to slink away toward the dark depths of the eucalyptus forest.</p>

                    <p>The boys laughed and lay down again in the sand, while Granser sighed  ponderously. He had eaten too much, and, with hands clasped on his  paunch, the fingers interlaced, he resumed his maunderings.</p>
